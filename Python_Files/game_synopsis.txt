Once upon a time there a young man named Cody Segfault (referred to as CS). 
All his life he wanted to be a knight, he trained for hours on end with his 
grandpa who had served the kingdom. When CS became of age he joined the knight 
academy. Cody wasn’t always conventional and often did things out of bounds 
(lame segfault joke). However, through perseverance (and a lack of people who 
wanted to be knights) CS became a knight. The day after the knighting ceremony, 
a calamity strikes the kingdom. The princess is kidnapped by Bob, the destroyer 
of grades! By trespassing into the kingdom of Clojure, Bob broke the age-old 
peace treaty between x kingdom and y kingdom. As such, war broke out, plunging 
the two kingdoms into chaos. Now it’s up to CS and his other knight friends to 
make their mark on history…but who knows what kind of mark it will be.
